TODO things for rise:
  * FIX THE DAMN AUTH ARCHITECTURE SO IT WORKS DAMN IT
  * Add a .keyfile to each upload containing a private key. This file will be used to make sure that the same uuid can't be uploaded to twice and for a future file deletion method.
  * Add said file deletion method
  * Add free and premium accounts (to the website too)
    - Add safe CC# storing for the local client
